# 🏡 Airbnb Listings Data Analysis – Boston

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listings and reviews from Boston during Q2 2024. It explores pricing strategies, guest sentiment, amenity impact, and availability patterns using data science techniques.

## 💡 Business Question
**How can Airbnb hosts and the platform optimize pricing, availability, and amenities to improve guest satisfaction and maximize revenue in Boston’s short-term rental market?**

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Pricing is highly skewed** and influenced by features like bathrooms and guest capacity.
2. **91.2% of reviews are positive**, with keywords like “clean” and “great” dominating.
3. **Amenities like Hot Tub and Gym** significantly boost price and ratings.
4. **Availability doesn’t strongly correlate** with price or reviews, but affects competition.
5. **Engineered features from reviews** (polarity, keywords, length) enhance predictive modeling.
